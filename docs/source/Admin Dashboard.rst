Admin Dashboard
===============

Introduction
-------------

The Admin Panel empowers Administrators to handle incoming and outgoing calls, as well as oversee communication with clients. It also tracks the issues faced by each client and maintains a record of their call history.

| The application grants Admins the capability to perform various call-related tasks such as initiating, answering, and transferring calls. 
| Additionally, they can oversee the performance of Agents through monitoring Live Status updates. 
| Admins are authorized to create or remove Agent accounts as needed. 
| In addition, they have the authority to allocate pending tickets to any extension based on the Ticket reports associated with each Agent.
